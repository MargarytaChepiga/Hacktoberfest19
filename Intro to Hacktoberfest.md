### Introduction to [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)


#### What is [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean and DEV.

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is open to everyone in our global community.
To participate, four pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories.
You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, 
or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community.
All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make four pull requests (PRs) 
between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues 
labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s 
code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete 
the challenge will earn a T-shirt.
